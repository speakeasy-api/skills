# Terraform Registry

The Speakeasy Generation GitHub Action can be configured to publish a generated Terraform provider. However, Terraform providers cannot be generated with Speakeasy while operating in monorepo mode. HashiCorp requires a separate repository for the Terraform provider code that follows their naming convention and must be public. For more information, refer to the [HashiCorp Terraform Registry documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/providers/publishing#preparing-your-provider).

Use the following steps to publish a generated Terraform provider to the HashiCorp Terraform Registry.

## Step 1: Create a Repository

Create a repository for the Terraform provider:

- Name the repository `terraform-provider-{NAME}`, with the `NAME` containing lowercase letters.
- Ensure it is a public repository.

## Step 2: Generate GPG Signing Key

Sign your Terraform provider releases with a signing key. Create and export a GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) signing key following the instructions in the GitHub guide to [Generating a new GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key). Generate your GPG key using either the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) or the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm.

## Step 3: Store GPG Key Details

Take note of the following values:

- The GPG private key.
- The GPG passphrase.
- The GPG public key.

## Step 4: Add Public Key to Repository

Add the ASCII-armored public key to the Terraform repository.

## Step 5: Configure Repository Secrets

Your GPG private key and GPG passphrase will be configured automatically when entered into the Speakeasy CLI. Ensure the following secrets are available to your repository:

- The GPG private key, `terraform_gpg_secret_key`.
- The GPG passphrase, `terraform_gpg_passphrase`.

## Step 6: Register with Terraform Registry

The first time you create and publish a Terraform provider using the Speakeasy Generation GitHub Action, you need to manually add it to the Terraform Registry. Subsequent updates will be published automatically. To begin this process, follow the [Terraform Registry instructions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/providers/publishing) and agree to the Terraform terms and conditions. Note that you will need to be an organizational admin to complete this step.

## Step 7: Add GitHub Actions Workflow

Add the following file to the `.github/workflows` directory to create releases for the Terraform provider using GoReleaser. If all the above steps are complete, the HashiCorp registry automatically picks up new changes.

```yaml
# Terraform Provider release workflow.
name: Release

# This GitHub Action creates a release when a tag that matches the pattern
# "v*" (e.g. v0.1.0) is created.
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'
  workflow_dispatch:

# Releases need permission to read and write the repository contents.
# GitHub considers creating releases and uploading assets as writing content.
permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  goreleaser:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4.2.2
        with:
          # Allow GoReleaser to access older tag information.
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: actions/setup-go@4d34df0c2316fe8122ab82dc22947d607c0c91f9 # v4.0.0
        with:
          go-version-file: 'go.mod'
          cache: true
      - name: Import GPG key
        uses: crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg@111c56156bcc6918c056dbef52164cfa583dc549 # v5.2.0
        id: import_gpg
        with:
          gpg_private_key: ${{ secrets.terraform_gpg_secret_key }}
          passphrase: ${{ secrets.terraform_gpg_passphrase }}
      - name: Run GoReleaser
        uses: goreleaser/goreleaser-action@286f3b13b1b49da4ac219696163fb8c1c93e1200 # v6.0.0
        with:
          args: release --clean
        env:
          # GitHub sets the GITHUB_TOKEN secret automatically.
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          GPG_FINGERPRINT: ${{ steps.import_gpg.outputs.fingerprint }}
```

## Step 8: Create GoReleaser Configuration

Finally, create a [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) file in the root of your repository:

```yaml
# Visit https://goreleaser.com for documentation on how to customize this
# behavior.
version: 2

before:
  hooks:
    # This is just an example and not a requirement for building or publishing providers.
    - go mod tidy
builds:
  - env:
      # GoReleaser does not work with CGO and could also complicate
      # usage by users in CI/CD systems, like Terraform Cloud, where
      # users are unable to install libraries.
      - CGO_ENABLED=0
    mod_timestamp: '{{ .CommitTimestamp }}'
    flags:
      - -trimpath
    ldflags:
      - '-s -w -X main.version={{.Version}} -X main.commit={{.Commit}}'
    goos:
      - freebsd
      - windows
      - linux
      - darwin
    goarch:
      - amd64
      - '386'
      - arm
      - arm64
    ignore:
      - goos: darwin
        goarch: '386'
    binary: '{{ .ProjectName }}_v{{ .Version }}'
archives:
  - format: zip
    name_template: '{{ .ProjectName }}_{{ .Version }}_{{ .Os }}_{{ .Arch }}'
checksum:
  extra_files:
    - glob: 'terraform-registry-manifest.json'
      name_template: '{{ .ProjectName }}_{{ .Version }}_manifest.json'
  name_template: '{{ .ProjectName }}_{{ .Version }}_SHA256SUMS'
  algorithm: sha256
signs:
  - artifacts: checksum
    args:
      # If you are using this in a GitHub Action or some other automated pipeline, you
      # need to pass the batch flag to indicate it's not interactive.
      - "--batch"
      - "--local-user"
      - "{{ .Env.GPG_FINGERPRINT }}" # set this environment variable for your signing key
      - "--output"
      - "${signature}"
      - "--detach-sign"
      - "${artifact}"
release:
  extra_files:
    - glob: 'terraform-registry-manifest.json'
      name_template: '{{ .ProjectName }}_{{ .Version }}_manifest.json'
  # If you want to manually examine the release before it goes live, uncomment this line:
  # draft: true
changelog:
  disable: true
```

## Automatic Publishing

Whenever you generate and merge a new PR for your Terraform provider, it will be automatically versioned and released to the HashiCorp Registry.
